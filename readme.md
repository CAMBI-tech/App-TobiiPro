# TobiiPro Connector

This app connects to a Tobii Pro device to the LabRecorder.
It requires you to get the [TobiiPro C SDK](https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/tobii-pro-sdk/#Download) and
make sure your use case is covered by the end user agreement.

## Building

- Extract the corresponding C SDK folder (e.g. Linux/64 for 64 bit Linux) to
this folder and rename it to `tobii`
- follow the [common build instructions](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/labstreaminglayer/blob/master/doc/BUILD.md#build-instructions)
